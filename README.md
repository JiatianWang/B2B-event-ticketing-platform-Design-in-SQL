# B2B-event-ticketing-platform-Design-in-SQL
## Business requirements:

Design a transactional database to analyze B2B event ticketing platform data for managing:

● Venue organizers 

● Venues and tickets

● Resellers

● Sold tickets 

## In this task:

I will track ticket sales by venue organizers and resellers. Resellers get a fixed commission per sold ticket. Resellers can have multiple branches offices or sell on their websites, while venue organizers can sell on-site or online.

## Reporting:

● Compare sales results by weeks and by channels Example: I want to know if sales results in Feb 2020 are better than results in Feb 2019 and I would like to drill it by resellers and event types 

● Comparison if the commission rate is in relation to sales results 

● Most popular tickets per offices, resellers 

Datebase Design:
