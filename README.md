# B2B-event-ticketing-platform-Design-in-SQL
## Business requirements:

I designed a B2B transactional ticketing platform. I would like to build a reporting system that will help decision-maker analyze business results and the needs of selling event tickets. 

In this task, I would like to track ticket sales by venue organizers and resellers. Resellers get a different commission per sold ticket based on different event. Resellers can have multiple branches offices or sell on their websites, while venue organizers can sell on-site or online. 

Key tables:

● Venue organizers 

● Customers

● Resellers

● Sold tickets 

## Reporting:

● Compare sales results by weeks and by channels Example: I want to know if sales results in Feb 2020 are better than results in Feb 2019 and I would like to drill it by resellers and event types 

● Comparison if the commission rate is in relation to sales results 

● Most popular tickets per offices, resellers 

Datebase Design:
